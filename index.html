        <h4>What is a refugee?</h4>
        <p>A refugee is any person who has been forced to leave their home. This could be due to War, violence, oppressive government, persecution, or natural disaster. Most countries in the UN accept refugees into their borders and provide humanitarian aid. However, often refugee camps are set up in neighboring countries to provide convenient aid. However, these camps are not popular with refugees, who often seek to be elsewhere.
        <h5>The Refugee Process</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>A traumatic event occurs in your country of origin. This could be a war, an oppressive dictator, a natural disaster. These events casuse the refugee-to-be to leave their home, and attempt to find a new country</li>
          <li>These refugees will usually apply for asylum in other countries. Some countries are more welcoming to refugees than others. These countries have accepted the most refugees in the last year:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Jordan (2.7 million)</li>
            <li>Turkey (2.5 million)</li>
            <li>Pakistan (1.6 million)</li>
            <li>Lebanon (1.5 million)</li>
            <li>Iran (979,400)</li>
            <li>Ethiopia (736,100)</li>
            <li>Kenya (553,900)</li>
            <li>Uganda (477,200)</li>
            <li>Democratic Republic of Congo (383,100)</li>
            <li>Chad (369,500)</li>
          </ol>
          <li>If they are granted asylum they will travel to the country for which they have been admitted. Even without legal asylum, some refugees with resort to illegal immigration, although, due the lack of admittances' and refugees' proximity, this number is not extremely high</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>In the United States</h5>
        <p>The United States can be a dreamland for a refugee, and like a dreamland, it is very difficult to get to in real life. You must first recieve a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). You then recieve an application to apply for refugee status, usually in your country's embassy. You will be interviewed by a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) representative. If you are accepted in the application, and you meet the admittance criteria, and the USCIS representative does not flag you, and you are able to pass a medical exam, you will recieve a culture overview and transportation to the United States.</p>
        <p>In the United States, at first, it can be difficult to acculturate to the broadly different culture, many refugees are able to sublimate to the modern culture within a year. Until they are able to get jobs, refugees often rely on the public safety net, but once acculturation occurs, they become standard members of society, paying into social programs, positively impacting the economy with their labor and skills, and participating in local events.</p>

          <p>Umayyads were the first people to go on a jihad, or holy war. They conquered several areas in Arabia and Africa. They displaced many people as they conquered different lands.

          <p>In the Abbasid empire, Christians and Jews had to pay a tax to ensure their protection. Those of neither religion, or those not wanting to pay the tax, were often displaced and forced to move by the government.</p>

          <p>The Slave Trade was one of the largest forced migration of people in history. 12.7 million refugees were shipped from Africa to the US via the triangular trade routes. These were often kidnapped or sold to force them to leave their country to go to America.</p>

          <p>Algeria’s Independence Struggle happened in this time period. After WWII, during decolonization, France left Algeria in a rush, not giving the proper time and resources to ensure stability. Fighting broke out, and civil strife is just being resolved now. Both Sudanese Civil Wars took place during this time period as well. The SPLA were rebelling against the government and the government was attacking villages to look for the SPLA. 4 million people were displaced and many sought refuge in Ethiopia and Kenya.</p>

          <h5>The War and Refugees</h5>
          <p>After the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, Rwanda invaded The DRC in 1996. Mobutu Sese Seko was overthrown and Laurent Desire Kabila took over. This became known as the First Congo War. The Second Congo war started soon after the first. Rwandan and Ugandan forces invaded the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the war began. Laurent Kabila was assassinated and his son Joseph came to power. These conflicts displaced over 2 million people and killed many more. These refugees had to flee to neighboring countries to try and escape their war torn country. Joseph Kabila established peace but there are still lasting effects from these wars.</p>

          <h5>Foreign Aid</h5>
          <p>Theses conflicts were horrible but thankfully many countries and organizations helped out. The UN issued Mission MONUSCO to help. The U.S.A. and United Kingdom were major financial helpers in this conflict. Angola also played its part in supporting the DRC.</p>
